Please note this and exclude this time from the total running time.\n","    - In order to help you with time counting, we placed a tqdm counter for Task 1 to indicate exactly how much time the text retrieval requires. The expected running time for Task 1 (as we noticed by running on Kaggle) is approximately 10-12 minutes. \n","    - Task 2 runs instantly\n","    - Although the model is fitted on the fly and it is not preloaded, fitting should not take more than a couple of minutes (4-5 minutes)\n","<br><br>\n","\n","- This notebook is meant to run in Kaggle environment. The needed files are placed under the working directory there. Those files are:\n","    - Full document corpus\n","    - Full queries file\n","    - Tokenized corpus\n","    - Query tests sets for Task 1 and Task 2\n","    - Corpus Embeddings for Task 1 and Task 2\n","<br><br>\n","\n","- This notebook contains only our final and best-scoring approach submitted in the Kaggle competition, and thus, it contains only the code needed for it.
